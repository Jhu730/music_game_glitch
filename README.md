Submitted by: **Jason Hu**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Since the Pre-Guide and video was extremely helpful and straight forward, I did not use much outside sources. When I was struggling with the JavaScript in the guess logic, I went online and used websites like https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp to get more information.] 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Some of the challenges I encountered were creating the logic in JavaScript for when the button was pressed and if the guess was correct. I tried to create it on my own without looking at the solution. It took me a while to figure it out, but once I got it working, i looked at the given solution and compared the code. From there, I tried to trim down my code and make it like the one given. But the effort I put in coding it myself when I was doing the stories on adding strikes. I was able to confidently know where the line was to create the logic for having three strikes. Despite JavaScript is like C++ and Python, I was still struggling a bit with my happens of writing code in another coding language. To overcome, i spend an hour just reading all the information given in the Pre-Work guide and online like https://www.w3schools.com/ to refresh key concepts. Another challenge was working with both JavaScript, CSS, and HTML at the same time. Learning each one's functions and how they interlink really helped me understand the project.] 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Some question I have about web development is how do you find the sprites you want to use? Do you make your own sprite/images or look for them online? Since web developers spend most of their time coding, I think that buying these sprites may be a safer play. What other skills do you need to become a good web developer? Howe different is it to be a web developer vs being an iOS or android developer? Is it better to have skills in both web development and apps? How do you become more creative in creating different U.I designs? Is coding more important in a website or how the website looks and run more important? What Api are helpful to use?] 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend the time creating the sprites I wanted for the buttons instead of looking online for them. I would also add more features like an easy to medium to hard level. I would like more user input in these games where players can enter what difficulty they want to play, the speed of the game or how many lives do they get. There will be a setting for a timer for each level. Custom sounds would be nice, I would like to make the project more themed like an animal theme game where the buttons will be the custom sprites of animals and they would make their animal sounds when clicked on. This way, the project will feel more unique.]
